To use this webpage you must create another database. (Should be created by the plugin now)

"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `log` (
  `id` int(8) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `action` enum('delete','unban','update') NOT NULL,
  `banid` int(8) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `ip` text NOT NULL,
  `data` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=28 ;"

With this you should be all set!


SETUP:
You just set passwords for all of the following files:
config.php

KNOWN BUG:
None? Pm me if you find any! (Serubin323)
